  abstract =   "A version of the communicating stream X-machine model is proposed, which gives a precise representation of the operation of transferring data from one X-machine to another. For this model it is shown that systems of communicating X-machines have the same computational power as single stream X-machines. This enable existing methods for deriving test strategies for stream X-machines to be extended to communicating stream X-machines.",
